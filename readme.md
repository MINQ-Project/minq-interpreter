## About MINQ
MINQ is a unique programming language with syntax based on lua, python and javascript. Here are some key aspects of MINQ:

- **Module Importing**: MINQ allows for flexible module importing. You can import built-in modules using the `import` statement or the `get_module` function. You can also import other Minq files using the `require` function from the `file` module.

- **Object-Oriented**: MINQ supports object-oriented programming. You can define classes and methods, and create objects from those classes.

- **Functionality**: MINQ is still in development, but it already has a range of functionality. You can perform a variety of tasks, from writing to the console to making a console game like quiz!
